# Minify

Minify your Python code for fun... and fun.

## Why?

For the lulz, mostly.

## But seriously, why?

I was bored and didn't want to do anything meaningful.

## Does it work with the entire Python syntax?

Not really. It's just a proof of concept.

## Can I use this package in my project?

Well, yeah. But then again: why?

## Why would I want to minify my Python code?

Let me put it this way: if this package is an answer, you're asking a wrong question.

## I found a bug in your code. Can you fix it?

I can't promise that, so probably it would be better if you fork it and fix on your own.

## Are you going to continue to work on this?

Probably not.
